### Welcome
Opening an issue before a pull request is preferred.  
**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, ...),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation,
accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

### Important
By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to
license your work under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE).
